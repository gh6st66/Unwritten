  "description": "Unwritten is a narrative-driven simulation game where the player inhabits a shifting world shaped by myth, language, and time.\n\nCore Loop: Players explore procedurally generated regions, interact through a parser system, and attempt actions that draw on a limited set of “learned words” — fragments of a proto-language that grant power when inscribed into masks or spoken in key moments.\n\nDeath and Continuity: Collapse (death) is not an endpoint but a trigger. Each collapse leaves traces in the world and may generate the player’s first mask, binding them more tightly to the game’s mythos.\n\nMasks: Forged at shrines, ruins, or dreamlike forges, masks define identity, grant abilities, and carry narrative weight. They are shaped by player choices, acquired words, and the location of forging.\n\nTime-Bound Progression: Resources and currency are tied to real-world time. This prevents rushing, pacing the experience so the world unfolds steadily and deliberately.\n\nWorld Simulation: The environment, NPCs, dialects, and ruins evolve procedurally. Systems draw inspiration from simulationist games (e.g., ecology, economy, weather) but are filtered through symbolic, dreamlike logic rather than strict realism.\n\nNarrative: The story emerges from interaction with the world and its systems. Instead of a fixed plot, the player’s journey is a weave of collapses, forged masks, and discovered words that slowly reveal the hidden structures of the world’s mythos.\n\n\nIn short: Unwritten is an exploration of language, identity, and persistence in a living, mythic world where every action writes a fragment of a story that cannot be told the same way twice.\n\nDo you want me to compress this further into a short tagline-style pitch (1–2 sentences), or keep it as a mid-length overview for things like design docs and pitches?\n\n",
