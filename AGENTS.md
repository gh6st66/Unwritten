# AGENTS.md

This file defines how **AI coding assistants** (e.g. GPT, Codex, Copilot Chat) should behave when contributing to or reviewing code in this repository. It is **not** a runtime system and does not control in-game agents or NPCs. Treat this as a contributor guide and rulebook for automated assistance during development.

Keep outputs deterministic, reversible, and aligned with Unwrittenâ€™s core pillars.
